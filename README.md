# Library Management System Project using SQL
## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Library Management System  

Managing libraries systematically is not an easy job for librarians, so that is the reason why they need a tool such as Library Management System.
We will create the database, including its tables. Imagine going to the library, picking up a book, and simply entering that book into the computer instead of writing down your details and the book information in a register. Isn’t that easy and convenient? That’s exactly what a library management system does. This system is helpful for both readers searching for books and librarians assisting them and tracking records. It ensures that everything is organized, as every person borrowing or returning a book must enter the transaction into the system.

## Objectives

1. Facilitating easy searching and borrowing of books by users.
2. Digitizing information and managing book borrowing effectively
3. Optimizing library management and operations
